**Transform your spreadsheets into powerful data management tools.**

## About DataMateApps  
Hi, I'm **Dan Northway**â€”Founder and Developer of **DataMateApps**.  

Before retiring, I spent my career as a **Construction Project Manager and Superintendent**, where spreadsheets were essential for managing everything from **timecards to pay applications**. However, **manual data logging** across countless Excel and PDF files was inefficient and prone to errors.  

I knew databases could streamline this process, but **Excel was the industry standard**. Thatâ€™s when I asked myself:  
> *What if I could turn Excel into a lightweight database?*  

Using **forms and VBA**, I built a system that **stored, logged, and organized data**, allowing for easy sorting and filtering. It became a critical tool in my workflow.

## The Birth of DataMate  
After retiring, I revisited the concept and had a lightbulb moment:  
> *Why not create a system that works with any form?*  

With the help of **ChatGPT**, **DataMate was born!**  

### What is DataMate?  
DataMate isnâ€™t a replacement for **full-scale databases like SQL** or **enterprise-level solutions**. Instead, it's designed for **small businesses and teams** already using spreadsheets but needing a **smarter, structured way to manage data**.  

It **bridges the gap between manual spreadsheets and more complex (often expensive) systems**, which are often overkill for smaller operations.  

---

## Why is DataMate Free?  
Because **the idea matters more than the programming.**  

For me, DataMate is both a **passion project** and a way to **keep my mind sharp** in retirement. But more importantly, I see it as a **legacyâ€”one that evolves with every user.**  

However, to keep this project alive and growing for future generations, **community support is essential**.
